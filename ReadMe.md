# Overview
This code is for ["Segment Aggregation for short utterances speaker verification using raw waveforms".]( https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.03329.pdf ) 
This paper proposed a method that compensates for the performance degradation of speaker verification, referred to as "segment aggregation".
The proposed method adopts an ensemble-based design to improve the stability and accuracy of speaker verification systems.

# Datasets
We used VoxCeleb2 dataset for training and VoxCeleb1 original evaluation set for test. 
Input two dataset in DB directory for training and test.

# Training
```
1. ./train_run.sh
2. python train_RawNet_SA_TS_rand.py -name rawnet_SA_TS_rand_1s_3s
```

# Test
```
Go into test directory
1. ./test_run.sh
2. python test_pre_trained_model.py -pretrained_name best_rawnet_SA_TS_1s_3s.pt
```
